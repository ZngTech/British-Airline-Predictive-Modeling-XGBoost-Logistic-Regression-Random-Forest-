# Python-DataScience-British-Airline
# This is a virtual internship experience project sponsored by British Airline and Forage.
# The programming langugae utilized is python and the coding environment is jupyter notebook supported by anaconda 3.0


## The project can be divided into 2 parts:  (1) Web-Scrapping and preliminary data exploration based on website reviews  (2) Machine learning and booking prediction based on 50,000 booking records.

# The project demands solid coding skills to conduct data scrapping, pre-processing, cleaning and exloration. Eventually, you are expected to train a model using machine learning algorithm ( package scikit - learn ) to predict booking and then evaluate the model.

# The utilimate goal is to deliver business insights to help British Airline growth their business and enhance customer experience.
